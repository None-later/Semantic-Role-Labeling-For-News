has unveiled a new and improved versys 1000 for 2019 at this year eicma show in milan the electronically sophisticated versys 1000 se lt the big advancement is in the bevy of rider aids and electronics this includes a new bosch imu which is minimal on hardware but utilizes specially designed software from kawasaki this unit informs a number of systems including the kawasaki electronic controlled suspension kawasaki intelligent abs and kawasaki traction control starting with kawasaki electronic controlled suspension the 43mm showa cartridge fork has compression and rebound damping controlled by the kecs system and riders can choose base settings in four different modes—sport road rain and rider manual it a sophisticated package that measures speed and compression information every millisecond and makes adjustments as necessary the showa bfrc lite rear shock also features compression and rebound damping adjustment by way of the system and allows the rider to electronically adjust preload kecs has three shock modes to select from—rider only rider with luggage and rider with passenger and luggage if things need to be fine-tuned there 10 levels of adjustment to work through six-spoke 17-inch wheels front and rear are brought to a stop by way of dual 310mm brake discs and four-piston radial mount calipers at the front and a 250mm disc with single piston caliper at the rear the kawasaki intelligent abs is the same as used on the zx-10r and ninja h2 kawasaki traction control comes with three modes tailored for the type of riding you expect to do and if you want to go the old fashioned way you can turn the system off as for the piece that powers the new bike it the same dohc 16-valve 1 043cc inline four engine that you’ll find in the versys 1000 lt however the new electronic throttle valves send information to the ecu to better control the fuel and air mixture for a better performing engine throughout the rev range there also no throttle cable as the evt system has an accelerator position sensor located in the throttle assembly engine performance can be managed by way of ride modes offering either full power or low power options and ride modes sport road rain or rider manual integrate the function of the ktrc kecs and selected power modes the six-speed transmission works by way of a kawasaki quick shifter allowing for clutchless shifting up and down the gearbox if you’re bound and determined to use the clutch though the slip and assist function will make for a lighter pull and smoother shifts the package is housed inside a five-piece cast aluminum frame that has a steering stem left and right main frames and two cross pieces it utilizes the engine as a stressed member the subframe is a steel tube trellis design there also an electronic cruise control system installed you get a chip installed in the info display that allows you to connect your smartphone to the bike using rideology the app from there you’ll be able to check vehicle stats ride logs and you’ll be able to make adjustments to various settings and if you get a wild hair late at night and want to change your settings you can input them into the app once you switch on the ignition with the smartphone in range those new settings will be implemented to keep tabs on all the currents and systems kawasaki gives riders a new tft display it has an analog tachometer alongside a full color tft lcd screen there a touring mode display and there also a sport riding display each providing layouts and bits of info important to the type of riding you’re doing and because this is still a touring motorcycle kawasaki has attended to ergonomics and other creature comforts too there a new adjustable windscreen that can be moved up or down from the cockpit without tools a revised vent layout is intended to reduce negative pressure and make the ride more comfortable it an upright ride and the rider triangle is relaxed perfect for days on the road standard kawasaki quick release 28 liter saddlebags are included as well they’re lockable and make use of a single key design so it can be opened and closed with the ignition key full led lighting throughout keeps the road illuminated ahead but also provides the means for cornering lights out front these cornering lights are built into the shrouds and each can cycle through three fixed directions dependent on lean angle the overall styling is improved too with an updated cowl and fairings slimmed-down reflectors a more compact exhaust muffler and new highly durable paint this is a

triumph has announced two new more-capable-than-ever scrambler models for 2019 the scrambler 1200 xc and scrambler 1200 xe raise the bar in the segment with bigger better engines and a swath of additional upgrades in build and technology the xc is what could be considered base trim while the xe boasts a number of upgrades for superior off-road performance both however come packing a retuned bonneville high-power 1 200cc parallel-twin engine this latest generation offers up nearly 90 hp at 7 400 rpm a gain of 12 5 percent over the mill powering the bonneville t120 torque is up also with 81 pound-feet of torque available at a low 3 950 rpm triumph claims this to be a 37 5-percent improvement in pull over the 2019 street scrambler remember though the new street scrambler packs triumph 900cc parallel twin so it makes sense to see such a dramatic difference both versions are liquid-cooled and come with ride by wire and have 10 000-mile service intervals and six-speed transmissions since triumph was keen to improve off-road prowess the suspension packages on both the xc and xe are improved as well particularly the setup at the rear riders will enjoy new öhlins kit at the back twin spring and fully adjustable the xc has a bit less travel at 7 9 inches while the xe gets nearly 10 inches of travel triumph updated the aluminum swingarm also to adequately handle the new long-travel setup the forks are from showa a 45mm fully adjustable usd setup with 7 9 inches on the xc and a 47mm fully adjustable usd setup with nearly 10 inches travel on the xe both versions roll on 36-spoke aluminum wheels set to take tubless tires 21 inches at the front and 17 inches at the back as for braking there are dual 320mm discs and brembo m50 monoblocks fore and a single 255mm disc brembo two-piston caliper aft on both versions the xc has switchable abs while the xe comes with switchable cornering abs triumph went full tilt on electronics particularly on the xe but the xc is no slouch with a second-generation tft display five riding modes all led lighting switchable traction control keyless ignition cruise control usb charger backlit switches an immobilizer and accessory fit tire pressure monitoring system the xe has all these features too but comes with a sixth ride mode off-road pro in addition to the road rain sport off-road and rider configurable options off-road pro turns off both abs and traction control and dials the throttle map to off-road settings this model also carries cornering traction control in addition to cornering abs thanks to an imu that doesn’t factor on the xc you get heated grips on the xe standard and can mount them to the xc as an accessory piece riders will also be able to make use of the first-ever bluetooth module offered by triumph which enables function of an integrated gopro control system connection and control will be displayed on the tft display and you’ll be able to manage video and photo functions by way of the switch gear this module is an accessory for both the xc and xe however get the module and you’ll also be able to use a new turn-by-turn navigation system triumph developed in partnership with google this marks the silicon valley giant first collaboration with a motorcycle manufacturer and the system includes route planners points of interest hotels gas stations and restaurants you’ll need to download the triumph app for iphone or android to make full use of the navigation package however then of course there also integrated phone and music operation on both 1200 models with phone operation handled on the switch gear and information displayed on the tft console then there the styling both have seamless scrambler fuel tanks 4 2 gallons brushed aluminum filler caps stainless steel tank straps bench seats and high-set dual exhaust canisters complete with classically heat shields the xe gets a few more touches like hand guards with an aluminum brace brembo mcs levers and gold-colored fork the xc will be available in either jet black matte black or khaki green brooklands green colorways while the xe will be dressed in either fusion white brooklands green or cobalt blue jet black triumph will offer a staggering range of accessories for a more personalized style for improved performance or to make these scramblers more capable of long-travel trips to help riders who can’t make up their minds triumph also has a few inspiration kits available the escape version has things like panniers led fog lamps a centerstand and fly screen included while the extreme kit has an arrow carbon silencer range of guards and caps led indicator kit and rear light relocation kit and headlight grille and bezel we expect to see these new scramblers arrive sometime in january of next year however
