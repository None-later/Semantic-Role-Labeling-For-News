shores more than 60 000tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel is stored on the shores of four of the five great lakes — in some cases mere yards from the waterline — in still-growing stockpiles it actually the most dangerous waste produced by any industry in the history of the earth said gordon edwards president of the nonprofit canadian coalition for nuclear responsibility the spent nuclear fuel is partly from 15 current or former u s nuclear power plants including four in michigan that have generated it over the past 50 years or more but most of the volume stored along the great lakes more than 50 000 tons comes from canadian nuclear facilities where nuclear power is far more prevalent it remains on the shorelines because there still nowhere else to put it the u s government broke a promise to provide the nuclear power industry with a central underground repository for the material by 1998 canada while farther along than the u s in the process of trying to find a place for the waste also doesn't have one yet more than 60 000 tons of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel is stored on the shores of the great lakes on both the u s and canadian sides keith matheny detroit free press the nuclear power industry and its federal regulator the u s nuclear regulatory commission point to spent nuclear fuel safe on-site storage over decades but the remote possibility of a worst-case scenario release — from a natural disaster a major accident or an act of terrorism — could cause unthinkable consequences for the great lakes region the nuclear power industry and its federal regulator the u s nuclear regulatory commission point to spent nuclear fuel safe on-site storage over decades but the remote possibility of a worst-case scenario release — from a natural disaster a major accident or an act of terrorism — could cause unthinkable consequences for the great lakes region scientific research has shown a radioactive cloud from a spent fuel pool fire would span hundreds of miles and force the evacuation of millions of residents in detroit chicago cleveland toronto or other population centers depending on where the accident occurred and wind patterns it would release multiple times the radiation that emanated from the fukushima disaster in japan in 2011 — a disaster that led to mass evacuations no-go zones that exist to this day and a government ban on fishing in a large offshore area of the pacific ocean because of high levels of radioactive cesium in the water and in fish the fishing industry there has yet to recover more than seven years later the mississippi and the great lakes — that would be really bad said frank von hippel senior research physicist and professor of public and international affairs emeritus at princeton university added jim olson environmental attorney and founder of the traverse city-based nonprofit for love of water or flow the fact that it on the shorelines of the great lakes takes that high consequence that would be anywhere and paints it red and puts exclamation marks around it spent nuclear fuel is so dangerous that a decade removed from a nuclear reactor its radioactivity would still be 20 times the level that would kill a person exposed to it some radioactive byproducts of nuclear power generation remain a health or environmental hazard for tens of thousands of years and even typically harmless radioactive isotopes that are easily blocked by skin or clothing can become extremely toxic if even small amounts are breathed in eaten or drank making their potential contamination of the great lakes — the drinking water supply to 40 million people — the connected mississippi river and the prime agricultural areas of the u s a potentially frightening prospect nuclear power is generated from the

towers of the fermi 2 nuclear power plant where more than 600 tons of spent nuclear fuel remains stored i think it a disgrace said ken evanoff who lives less than a mile from the reactor all of us can complain about it but there ain't nothing that going to be done about it in the long run when is it going to change a block closer to the plant in estral beach craig borowski has lived with fermi 2 out his window for three decades it always in the back of your mind he said it like a war zone and that waste is the collateral damage of our existence it the easiest path to take versus doing the right thing for five years michigan residents lawmakers environmental groups and others around the midwest have loudly and nearly unanimously opposed a planned canadian underground repository for low-to-medium radioactive waste at kincardine ontario near the shores of lake huron meanwhile spent nuclear fuel vastly more radioactive sits not far from the shores of four great lakes — michigan huron erie and ontario — at 15 currently operating or former nuclear power plant sites on the u s side in michigan that includes fermi 2 the donald c cook nuclear plant in berrien county the palisades nuclear plant in van buren county and the former big rock point nuclear plant in charlevoix county which ceased operation in 1997 and where now only casks of spent nuclear fuel remain neither the u s nor the canadian government has constructed a central collection site for the spent nuclear fuel it not just a problem in the great lakes region — more than 88 000 tons of spent nuclear fuel an amount that is rising is stored at 121 u s locations across 39 states stephen tait is a spokesman for dte energy fermi 2 nuclear plant where the stores of spent nuclear fuel near the shores of lake erie date to when the plant started commercial operation in 1988 our canisters and buildings are able to withstand the impacts of natural disasters man-made objects terrorist attacks wide-bodied commercial aircraft impacts he said all of our used fuel is stored maintained and protected with safety as our top priority wet and dry spent nuclear fuel isn’t only radioactive it continues to generate heat it requires storage in pools with circulating water for typically five years before it can be moved into so-called dry-cask storage — concrete-and-steel obelisks where spent fuel rods receive continued cooling by circulating air in practice however because of the high costs associated with transferring waste from wet pools to dry casks nuclear plants have kept decades worth of spent fuel in wet storage plant officials instead re-rack the pools reconfiguring them to add more and more spent fuel well beyond the capacities for which the pools were originally designed the prevailing practice in the united states is you re-rack the pools until they are just about as dense-packed as the nuclear core von hippel said only in recent years have nuclear plants stepped up the transition to dry cask storage because there no room left in the wet pools still about two-thirds of on-site spent nuclear fuel remains in wet pools in the u s spent nuclear fuel is stored in a pool at the pickering nuclear
