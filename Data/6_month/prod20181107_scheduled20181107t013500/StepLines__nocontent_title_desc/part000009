and french fried onions a new jersey- native reilly worked for campbell in camden the same city where she grew up her assignment a vegetable side dish with green beans and campbell cream of mushroom soup requested by the associated press what reilly team came up with is one of the most successful product-based recipes of all time peruse any modern food publication thanksgiving content and you’d be hard-pressed not to find some sort of green bean casserole of course the green bean casseroles published today don’t all look like reilly not quite photo by julia gartland reilly original recipe debuted in 1955 when supermarkets were springing up like weeds and premade products were the best thing since sliced bread as jessamyn neuhaus writes in manly meals and mom home cooking some cookbooks published in the 1950s confined all their soup recipes to mixing and doctoring canned soups in the decades since processed foods have become less popular and many food publications shy away from using them but people still can’t get enough of that green bean casserole so what happened next was inevitable right food publications started publishing homemade takes on the green bean casserole dish evolutions often move in the opposite direction— like mom made it hints at stirring a pot for hours not opening a can but the green bean casserole was never supposed to be made from scratch and yet us recipe developers can’t resist let scan the mix we published homemade green bean casserole in 2010 smitten kitchen published a green bean casserole with crispy onions in 2013 bon appétit published ba best green bean casserole in 2016 the kitchn published classic green bean casserole from scratch in 2017 homemade green bean casserole by plum pie green bean casserole by sara jenkins some patterns the packaged fried onions are replaced with floured and fried shallots or onions or not replaced at all the cream of mushroom is mimicked with either 1 a traditional roux equal parts flour and fat or 2 flour added to sautéing mushrooms which creates a thick gravy-like sauce the liquid isn’t one ingredient here are the combinations from the recipes listed above 1 white wine vegetable broth half-and-half 2 vegetable or chicken broth heavy cream 3 whole milk heavy cream 4 whole milk chicken broth special guests appear such as garlic nutmeg parmesan and thyme the casserole is baked like the original—and uh like all casseroles photo by julia gartland this big little recipe changes things up a bit crispy-fried shallots don’t need flour i learned this trick from sarah jampel who learned it from our test kitchen director josh cohen by adding the thinly sliced shallots to room-temperature oil then putting the pan on the stove you slowly but surely eliminate all their moisture yielding crinkly wrinkly golden-brown beauties this goes against the standard frying approach adding food directly to 365°f-ish oil but it works the cream of mushroom doesn’t need flour either campbell canned soup was my inspiration here or the title was condensed cream of mushroom why don’t we just use cream and mushrooms and condense cook the mixture until it the right consistency here how sauté mushrooms until they’re well browned add a ton of cream and cook away make sure your pan is big enough so nothing boils over but do keep it at a powerful rolling boil stirring occasionally to prevent any burning this not only reduces the cream into a bean-clinging thickness but infuses it with mushroom flavor and color all those other ingredients we don’t need ’em cream has this covered love you cream and those other guys like cheese and spices our star ingredients can sing on their own generously salting at each step makes the green beans taste green beanier the mushroom sauce taste mushroomier and the shallots taste shallotier which to me makes the green bean casserole itself taste green bean casserole-ier skip the oven recipes love to talk about using as few dishes as possible but what about ones that use as few appliances as possible the beauty of the original recipe was it just used an oven this recreation just uses the stove on any given night i love the simplicity of this but on thanksgiving it just practical there probably a 15-pound turkey and some stuffing in your oven plus a sweet potato casserole and pie waiting in line so let the green bean casserole take one for the team first cook the beans in boiling water psst this can be done in advance just make sure they’re room temperature before adding to the mushroom-cream sauce the rest all takes place in the same skillet you can serve directly out of there or transfer to a cutesy casserole dish because there no oven time it not technically a casserole but i hope reilly would’ve loved it all the same
