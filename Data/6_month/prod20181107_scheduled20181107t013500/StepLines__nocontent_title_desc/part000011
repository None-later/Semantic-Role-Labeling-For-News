sexual abuse after adopted parents arrest s a woman shares horrific story of 15 years of sexual abuse court records claim the husband and wife forced the girl into threesomes which resulted in three children who were led to believe their real mother was their older sister every sunday hundreds of believers would flock to st peregrine chapel a little shed in the back of the castillos home to visit an 8-year-old girl they claimed as their daughter the miracle child often seen wearing an oversized crucifix necklace and white lace veil was the talk of san antonio in early 2013 even garnering two stories on fox san antonio affiliate kabb-tv according to documents obtained by mysa com laura and eusebio allegedly committed numerous rapes and assaults against the miracle child true mother abigail alvarado who was the castillos adopted daughter and niece the miracle child and two other children were born from the alleged rapes according to forensic lab reports that found a match between the dna of the children and that of eusebio laura and eusebio are now facing charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child a first-degree felony the castillos are both scheduled to make a court appearance on august 7 the castillos arrests mark the peak of a years-long investigation that began on july 20 2014 when abigail who goes by abby now an adult who wants her story told informed police of the abuse she had endured since at least age 9 rape lies and threats were part of her daily routine and she says the only reasons she didn't hurt herself or someone else were her children who were born out of the abuse and will remain unnamed at her request child protective services took her and her younger brother and older sister away from their mother maria rodriguez due to her addiction to drugs and alcohol and inability to care for her children after the state took custody of abbyand her siblings they were placed in a shelter where they remained until her older sister brought up the idea of contacting their uncle eusebio rodriguez brother who was a sergeant in the u s army stationed in honolulu hawaii abbysaid her sister tried get help from child protective services years later but she claimed eusebio had her so afraid of being jailed herself that she refused to cooperate with the investigation according to laura indictment she forced abbyto perform sexual acts on eusebio and herself and she and eusebio forced sexual acts upon abby graphic details of the alleged abuse will be withheld from this story but the indictment accuses both laura and eusebio of forcing abbyto submit and participate by the physical use of force and violence abbysaid she thought of contacting law enforcement authorities but eusebio was constantly threatening her and physically assaulting her if she disobeyed allegations that appear to be reiterated by laura indictment which claims abbywas threatened with bodily injury on numerous occasions photos from laura now-deleted facebook profile show her and eusebio posing with the children accompanied by captions portraying eusebio as the father and herself as the mother the castillo st peregrine chapel named after the patron saint for people suffering from cancer was rapidly gaining popularity at the time the chapel was founded with the help of archbishop john parnell the primate of the mexican national catholic church an obscure branch of the catholic church that is believed to have begun in the 1920s during the mexican revolution parnell said he believes that salinas healing abilities and the donations with which they were rewarded gave conniving laura the idea to spread the word that abby eldest child whom she claimed was her own daughter was a saint as a money-making scheme parnell introduced me to laura and eusebio pointed to his children these nice small tiny beautiful children rudy said according to rudy laura beat the living crap out of abbythat day according to his affidavit eusebio on one occasion became frightened that abbywould report his abuse to authorities so he doused himself and his house in gasoline and threatened to burn everything down including her children despite the terrors at home abbytried to hide the truth from rudy for fear he would leave her if he knew who the real father of her children was abbydidn't want to go to the police immediately for fear of retaliation by eusebio and she believed she would also go to jail so the two tried to maintain their difficult relationship with both eusebio and laura still hovering around laura and eusebio whereabouts were unknown until december 2016 more than two years later when laura who claims she suffers from lupus posted a gofundme page to her facebook account to try to raise money for medical expenses within two months police had obtained a warrant for eusebio dna which came back from a forensic lab as a match with abby children because of the nature of the sexual assaults dna evidence would not work in the criminal case against laura but prosecutors were able to indict her on a charge of aggravated sexual assault based on witness testimony mcpeak said all of the cases he works on as a sex crimes investigator are disturbing but the familial aspect of the castillos alleged crimes was particularly disturbing laura eusebio eusébio eusebio castillo castillos abby rudy alvarado	After adopted parents' arrest, S.A.
