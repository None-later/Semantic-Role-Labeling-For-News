376263	http://www.fox2detroit.com/sports/red-wings-to-retire-red-kelly-s-no-4-jersey~240	red wings to retire red kelly no 4 jersey detroit – ilitch holdings president and ceo and detroit red wings governor christopher ilitch today announced that the red wings will officially retire leonard red kelly no 4 in a special ceremony on feb 1 2019 when the red wings host the rival toronto maple leafs red is one of the greatest red wings in the history of the franchise and we think it long overdue for the organization to celebrate his numerous accomplishments said christopher ilitch red was a prolific player for two decades and was a leader for the red wings during one of the most dominant decades in franchise history which brought four stanley cup championships to detroit when mrs ilitch and i spoke with red and his wife andra they were absolutely and authentically thrilled as were we in sharing the news we are looking forward to this special celebration with red and his family i wish to thank marian and chris ilitch for this great honor said red kelly the red wings gave me my start in the nhl 71 seasons ago i proudly wear the ring which commemorates the four stanley cups the team won when i played for detroit i treasure the memories i made during my time with the team playing alongside some of the greatest players and people in the league history i am truly grateful that my number will be raised next to those of several of my former teammates kelly a 1969 inductee into the hockey hall of fame spent parts of 13 seasons with the red wings and wore the red and white sweater for 846 of his 1 316 career games during his tenure in detroit he accumulated 472 points 162-310-472 and 253 penalty minutes ultimately finishing his career with 823 points 281-542-823 and 327 penalty minutes in 20 nhl seasons between the red wings and toronto maple leafs although he finished his career playing center for the maple leafs kelly was a defenseman for the red wings and was the first-ever recipient of the james norris memorial trophy as the league top defenseman in 1953-54 the red wings signed kelly as a 19-year-old prospect after he attracted the attention of a detroit scout while he was attending st michael college school in toronto in 1946-47 that season he led the st michael majors to a 1947 memorial cup championship as the top team in all of canadian junior hockey kelly would advance directly to the nhl the following season debuting for the red wings in 1947-48 without spending any time in the minor leagues there are very few players in the history of the national hockey league with the resume of red kelly said red wings senior vice president jim devellano he was a tremendous player on both ends of the ice and really revolutionized how the defensive position was played in an era where defensemen were not known for scoring a lot of goals he encapsulated what it means to be a red wing and i am thrilled that he is getting this deserved recognition kelly made an immediate impact on the detroit blueline in the 1949-50 campaign just his third season with the team kelly became the third defenseman in detroit franchise history to reach double-digit goals a feat he repeated each year until 1958-59 averaging 16 goals per season in that stretch he was the nhl top defenseman in goals and points for five-straight seasons from 1949-55 and led all red wings defensemen in points in nine-consecutive years from 1949-58 with kelly on the blueline contributing to a prolific offense that included the likes of sid abel alex delvecchio gordie howe and ted lindsay the red wings’ dynasty of the 1950s captured stanley cup championships in 1950 1952 1954 and 1955 kelly also served as the red wings’ captain in his final two seasons with the team 1956-58 one of the most dominant defensemen of his era kelly was named to the postseason nhl all-star team in eight-consecutive years making the first all-star team from 1951-55 and 1957 and the second all-star team in 1950 and 1956 he also won the lady byng trophy in 1951 1953 and 1954 for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct and finished in the top five in hart memorial trophy voting as the league most valuable player on four occasions during his time with the red wings along with his norris trophy win in 1954 in addition to his unique distinction as a player who had prolonged success as both a forward and defenseman kelly also has the honor of being the only player in nhl history to win more than six stanley cup championships without playing for the montreal canadiens kelly eight stanley cups are tied for fourth-most in league history and put him on an exclusive list of players who have won eight-or-more championships along with henri richard 11 jean beliveau 10 claude provost 9 yvan cournoyer 8 jacques lemaire 8 and maurice richard 8 four of his stanley cup championships came with the maple leafs where he spent the final eight seasons of his career from 1959-67 after a trade to toronto late in the 1959-60 campaign which prompted his position switch to center his offensive totals improved with the move to center producing 351 points 119-232-351 and just 74 penalty minutes in his 470 career games in toronto including three-straight 20-goal seasons from 1960-63 and a career-high 70 points 20-50-70 over 64 games in 1960-61 kelly would add one more lady byng trophy in 1961 with toronto and saw his name etched on the stanley cup in 1962 1963 1964 and 1967 kelly appeared in the stanley cup final 12 times falling short with the red wings in 1948 1949 and 1956 and with the maple leafs in 1960 upon retiring following his eighth stanley cup championship in 1967 kelly began a decade-long career as a head coach he was the first-ever head coach of the expansion los angeles kings from 1967-69 and later had four-year stints in the same capacity with the pittsburgh penguins 1969-73 and maple leafs 1973-77 kelly teams qualified for the playoffs in eight of his 10 seasons behind the bench and his all-time coaching record finished at 278-330-134 additionally while he was still playing for toronto kelly was elected a federal member of parliament in 1962 and served in the legislature for three years during this time he would shuttle between toronto and ottawa several times per week throughout the season now 91 years old kelly was named one of the 100 greatest nhl players as part of the league celebration of its 100th anniversary in 2016-17 his no 4 also hung in the maple leafs’ rafters as an honored number until all honored numbers were officially retired by the organization on oct 15 2016 kelly no 4 becomes the red wings’ eighth retired number in franchise history joining sid abel no 12 alex delvecchio no 10 gordie howe no 9 nicklas
