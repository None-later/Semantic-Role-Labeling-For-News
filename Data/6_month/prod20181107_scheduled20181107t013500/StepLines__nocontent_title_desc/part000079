hot dogs at a tent that had been set up stood in line to enter the amusement area and then one by one sped down the big water slide until a custodian hurried them along so others could play the boys walked along the edge of it and then one spotted a secluded spot beyond a grove of trees just weeks from reporting for his third nfl season as a running back for the kansas city chiefs delaney had come to monroe from his home in haughton about 90 miles away to help promote the events at the park that day from his position under the tree he had an unobstructed view of the boys who locked hands and waded slowly into the shallows step by step they splashed on until suddenly in the blink of a startled eye they fell together over an unseen ledge on the bottom of the pond and found themselves clawing at the air bubbles that surrounded them in the bad dreams that have plagued him through the years he always could see himself standing there on the bank as police divers drag up harry and lancer eyes closed and splayed beneath a team of paramedics in the case of joe delaney whose arc was only beginning to soar the circumstances that conspired to bring him down from his trajectory came upon him unforeseen suddenly and altered the lives of an array of people bobbing in his steep wake are his beloved widow carolyn who summoned a courage to endure that she could not know she had their three daughters only two of whom barely remember him but are shepherded by his spirit and alas lemarkits at 27 holland sits behind bars on a drug conviction here at the ouachita parish correctional center or as it is known locally the pea farm the grounds of which are used by inmates to grow produce wearing a red jump suit and sandals holland is ushered by a guard into a bare interview room at the prison and joined on this december day by his attorney robert c johnson in jail since police picked him up in september holland pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced on each count to five years to run concurrently while delaney was coming off a subpar year in 1982 in part because of an eye operation he had during the offseason to fix a detached retina the chiefs were prepared to sign him to a lucrative contract just before he died the delaneys were supposed to leave for kansas city two days later and set up housekeeping there before the start of training camp when carolyn delaney looks back on what happened instead she is overcome with a sadness that remains just beyond words with the only love she could ever imagine gone carolyn dedicated herself to the upbringing of her three daughters taking on jobs as a day-care teacher and then as a driver for one of the local casinos joe would be proud of how carolyn has held the household together despite the fact that her income has been small and back taxes recently have forced her to sell the home she and joe built years ago with pity in her eyes as she sits at her dining room table in haughton she says that what happened to holland leaves her feeling angry while his mother conceded that she should have received counseling she says she was overcome with grief over the loss of harry and spiraled into alcoholism when schoolteachers corrected him he became consumed by an unspoken rage beneath which stood a hidden reservoir of tears over harry lancer and joe with eyes lowered and hands folded on the table before him at the pea farm lemarkits says sometime i feel like it should have been me who died carolyn remembers that he kept running back into the house to kiss his daughters goodbye and asked if the two oldest tamika and crystal could join him on his trip carolyn attended northwestern state university at natchitoches with joe but dropped out after a year when she and joe wed and their eldest daughter tamika was born converted to a running back by demons coach a l williams the 5-10 185-pound delaney became the only state player to rush for 3 000 career yards the couple had their second daughter crystal when joe was in his senior year toward the end of which the chiefs selected him in the second round of the 1981 nfl draft slowed by the eye operation that delayed his participation in training camp and held to just 380 yards on 95 carries in eight games during strike-shortened 1982 he had every reason to expect that the year ahead would bring better days as he drove into chennault park that day in june 1983 holland had been dropped off at the park with his brother sister lamisa and lancer by his dad harry sr who had gone off to buy beer and ice only later would lemarkits discover that a hole had been dug by the builders of the water slide and that it had been filled in with water the pond fell precipitously to a depth of 20 feet at the edge of the shallows so it was as if a trapdoor had fallen from beneath the three boys carolyn was relaxing in a rocking chair on the porch with joanna on her lap when the phone rang inside the house uneasy silence filled the car as johnson headed east on interstate 20 and stood on the accelerator carolyn just looked out her window at the passing swampland and wondered what possibly could have happened uncertain exactly where st francis medical center was located johnson stopped at a convenience store in monroe to ask for directions only to learn what had happened from
