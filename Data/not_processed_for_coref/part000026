feel good about the running back hamstring after a pregame workout on sunday the team plans to put cook back on the field for the first time since week 4 playing him for 15-20 snaps on sunday as league sources had told the star tribune on friday if all goes well on sunday morning and cook is indeed on the field against the detroit lions he might help the vikings as much in the passing game as in the running game wide receivers adam thielen and stefon diggs have 181 of quarterback kirk cousins 334 targets this season taking up an outsize portion of the work in an offense that thrown the ball more than any in the league this season with diggs status in doubt because of a rib injury that kept him out of practice all week and led the vikings to call chad beebe up from the practice squad on saturday the team could have to rely on a larger group of options to complement thielen that where cook could come in while the running back has struggled to find running room behind the vikings offensive line this season carrying just 36 times for 98 yards he been more productive as a receiver catching nine passes for 107 yards the vikings will have to shift their line again on sunday with tom compton out because of a sprained knee and latavius murray has shown himself to be a good fit with many of the vikings inside zone runs in recent weeks if the vikings want to make the most of cook in a limited dose of work on sunday it very well could be by getting him the ball on screen passes or throws to the perimeter i don't know how much it the running game or passing game coach mike zimmer said on friday just overall i think he will help us the vikings have put cook through a wide range of treatment options in recent weeks and though the running back said on thursday he feeling like himself again he won't have a complete idea of how healthy he is until he gets into a game if the vikings plan holds and cook is able to go his return could come at a good time here are some other notes and thoughts as the vikings prepare to face the lions on sunday 2 diggs absence on sunday wouldmark the latest point in the wide receiver career he missed a game he didn't play the first three weeks of his rookie season before charles johnson broken ribs opened up a spot for him he sat out in week 5 of the 2016 season because of a groin injury and first missed a game in week 6 because of a groin injury last season diggs has 58 catches through eight games if he back after the vikings bye week he could still have a solid chance to post his first 100-catch season 3 with andrew sendejo expected to return from a groin injury on sunday the vikings should have five healthy safeties against the lions harrison smith sendejo jayron kearse anthony harris and george iloka they've given larger roles to kearse and iloka through their big nickel package and used harris for most of the game after iloka was benched after five snaps following a mistake in coverage last week against the saints the vikings could turn to their three-safety look frequently to help deal with kerryon johnson with anthony barr out but even so it will be interesting to see if they have all five safeties active for sunday game 4 the vikings revolving door at kick returner could continue on sunday with roc thomas out because of a hamstring injury special teams coordinator mike priefer put marcus sherels on kick returns after thomas was injured last week and sherels could work there again against the lions priefer also said he comfortable with holton hill and brandon zylstra on kick returns though zylstra could see a larger role at wide receiver on sunday in light of diggs injury as aldrick robinson mentioned on friday in any case it been a new challenge for priefer after years of pro bowl return men when i got here percy harvin was the guy priefer said when he was being used heavily on offense i couldn't use him as much i think he only had 16 returns that first year i was here but he was still very effective cordarrelle patterson wasn't used as much so obviously we used him on every rep when he was a healthy guy i think with the injuries and the way guys are being used on offense and defense it been a little bit of a challenge that is what i do i think that is what we do on special teams we have to get all of those young guys ready 5 when the nfl changed its touchback rules before the 2016 season moving the ball from the 20-yard line to the 25 after touchbacks priefer had said the vikings would continue to be aggressive about bringing the ball out of the end zone now that patterson has moved on the vikings have a rotating cast of return men thielen tom compton dalvin cook meteor games coordinator george iloka andrew sendejo vikings michael thomas chad beebe
