unfit preserving only those who conformed to a nordic stereotype during the 20th century first decades california eugenicists included potent but little-known race scientists such as army venereal disease specialist dr paul popenoe citrus magnate paul gosney sacramento banker charles goethe as well as members of the california state board of charities and corrections and the university of california board of regents eugenics would have been so much bizarre parlor talk had it not been for extensive financing by corporate philanthropies specifically the carnegie institution the rockefeller foundation and the harriman railroad fortune stanford president david starr jordan originated the notion of race and blood in his 1902 racial epistle blood of a nation in which the university scholar declared that human qualities and conditions such as talent and poverty were passed through the blood in 1904 the carnegie institution established a laboratory complex at cold spring harbor on long island that stockpiled millions of index cards on ordinary americans as researchers carefully plotted the removal of families bloodlines and whole peoples from cold spring harbor eugenics advocates agitated in the legislatures of america as well as the nation social service agencies and associations the harriman railroad fortune paid local charities such as the new york bureau of industries and immigration to seek out jewish italian and other immigrants in new york and other crowded cities and subject them to deportation confinement or forced sterilization much of the spiritual guidance and political agitation for the american eugenics movement came from california quasi-autonomous eugenic societies such as pasadena human betterment foundation and the california branch of the american eugenics society which coordinated much of their activity with the eugenics research society in long island american eugenics advocates believed with religious fervor that the same mendelian concepts determining the color and size of peas corn and cattle also governed the social and intellectual character of man in the process the movement intended to subtract emancipated negroes immigrant asian laborers indians hispanics east europeans jews dark- haired hill folk poor people the infirm and anyone classified outside the gentrified genetic lines drawn up by american raceologists by identifying so-called defective family trees and subjecting them to lifelong segregation and sterilization programs to kill their bloodlines in 1918 popenoe the army venereal disease specialist during world war i co-wrote the widely used textbook applied eugenics which argued from an historical point of view the first method which presents itself is execution applied eugenics also devoted a chapter to lethal selection which operated through the destruction of the individual by some adverse feature of the environment such as excessive cold or bacteria or by bodily deficiency many mental institutions and doctors practiced improvised medical lethality and passive euthanasia on their own other sterilization centers included agnews mendocino napa norwalk stockton and pacific colony state hospitals only after eugenics became entrenched in the united states was the campaign transplanted into germany in no small measure through the efforts of california eugenicists who published booklets idealizing sterilization and circulated them to german officials and scientists doctors would create the science devise the eugenic formulas and hand-select the victims for sterilization euthanasia and mass extermination in 1934 as germany sterilizations were accelerating beyond 5 000 per month the california eugenics leader c m goethe upon returning from germany
