250929	http://www.startribune.com/john-defilippo-keeps-vikings-play-calling-flexible-without-dalvin-cook/498141551~1440	john defilippo keeps vikings play-calling flexible without dalvin cook for the fourth time in five games on sunday the vikings will be without dalvin cook the second-year running back they'd planned to feature as both a runner and receiver in their offense this season cook could return to a headlining role once he recovered from his hamstring injury but he played only 18 snaps since he was injured in week 2 and has been ruled out for sunday game against the jets a week after a rocky pregame workout forced the vikings to scratch him cook was a full participant in practice on wednesday before missing thursday and friday practice sessions as the running back has struggled to get back on the field offensive coordinator john defilippo has been forced to remain cautious with how much he plans for the running back in his game plan i'll be honest with you it not easy he said in game-planning sessions on tuesdays you have to be really careful about the volume of plays that you're putting in for one person it not just dalvin it could be anybody that in that situation you get too caught up in the piece well then he up you got to get the ball to him in practice – there a whole laundry list of things that go in to what you just brought up you make it work and there ways in your offense to get certain guys to the football that you just carry every week you just roll with those but at the same time i feel bad for dalvin because he wants to be out there but at the same time you don't want to put any player in harm way without cook last sunday the vikings gave 24 carries to latavius murray who punished the cardinals 31st-ranked run defense for 155 yards and posted the best day by a vikings running back since adrian peterson left town murray will get the call again on sunday as defilippo plans the running game with the veteran taking the lead you adjust we're very fortunate on this team that we have other guys that can make plays i've been on teams before where you have one of your legit guys go down and all of a sudden it tough sledding he said we're fortunate that we have enough guys at other spots at the tight end position the running back position and at the receiver position obviously that can make plays for us here are some other vikings notes and observations as the team prepares to face the jets on sunday 2 with danielle hunter ability to chase down running backs and anthony barr and trae waynes making open-field tackles the vikings have proved to be a difficult opponent for teams looking to establish an outside run game according to nfl game statistics and information systems the vikings have the league sixth-best run defense on plays run toward both the left and right ends their ability to make open-field tackles and force the ball back inside could be tested on sunday against a jets run game that has thrived on outside runs they do an excellent job on bounce-out plays making corners have to make tackles and crack replace defensive coordinator george edwards said their receivers do a good job of blocking we've got our work cut out for us to limit their running game 3 the loss of mike hughes for the season means the vikings will likely have more work for holton hill the rookie corner who received more guaranteed money 75 000 than any undrafted free agent in the mike zimmer era after he slipped out of the draft hill moves up the vikings cornerback depth chart with hughes out and he could wind up as the team new kick returner as well he will have to play more gunner he will be playing on kickoff and kickoff return maybe as the returner this week special teams coordinator mike priefer said punt returner he is still a work in progress i don't know how comfortable i am putting him back there as the returner yet but he is working hard at it 4 priefer said he wasn't likely to sleep much on saturday night because of andre roberts the jets dynamic return man who already got a 78-yard punt return for a touchdown this season the vikings have cleaned up the punt coverage issues that plagued them during the preseason and haven't allowed a punt return longer than 11 yards so far this season i think since the season started we've been pretty good and we want to keep that trend up priefer said we kept the guys that were good and we didn't keep the guys that weren't so good i think that usually what it comes down to 5 the vikings will play the jets for just the 11th time in franchise history on sunday they'll be looking for only their third win against the jets four years after they ended a 29-year drought against new york the previous matchup between the teams in 2014 chris spielman dalvin cook
